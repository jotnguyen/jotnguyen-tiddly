Irritable at Mack and coworkers and roommates

Toxic relationship patterns with Mack Sarah pointed out

Food on the floor

Argued about her exes. Sarah said I put her in a lose lose situation because I would feel bad no matter what she said

What's the root of this? I feel unloveable and unappreciated

Why unloveable? self fulfilling prophecy where I am afraid the other person will leave so I leave first

Im not in control and so that's why I mention breaking up, suicide and in these situations Im in control and dont give the other person the ability to hurt me by trusting them

Have not felt this intensely angry or irritable in years. Sarah thinks depakote. I dont know how to deal with this irritabilit

Feel the irritability in your body and try to give it a moment to distance yourself from the feeling

Maybe go for a shower or run

Unloveable or underappreciated
